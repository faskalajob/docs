# Saved views

**Saved Views** lets you create, name, and easily access custom test filters within Test Engine. This is useful for teams who frequently search using the same set of tags or labels.

## Adding filters

1. On the **Tests** page, select **Add filter**, then select either an [Execution tag](/docs/test-engine/tags) or [Test label](/docs/test-engine/labels) as your filter type.
1. If filtering by tag, choose a tag key from the list of keys found in your recent executions.
1. Add a value for your filter and select **Add filter**.

## Saving views

Once a set of filters have been added to the **Tests** page, you can now save this as a view:

1. Select **Save** in the filter bar.
1. Give your view a name.
1. Select **Save view**.

Your new view will now appear in the sidebar under **Tests**, and will be visible to all users in the test suite.

## Deleting views

Saved views can be deleted from the test suite's settings:

1. Navigate to the test suite's **Settings** > **Saved Views**.
1. On the view to be deleted, select its **Delete** button.
